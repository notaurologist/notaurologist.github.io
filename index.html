    Hi there. My name is Jason LeMoine, and I'm a software engineer in Virginia Beach. I am not a urologist—that's the other guy. While I'm not any help in that “area,” if you need some programming done, I may be able to help. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlemoine" title="My LinkedIn profile" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/notaurologist" title="My GitHub profile" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> profiles for more info.
